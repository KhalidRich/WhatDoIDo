To those eyes (un?)-lucky enough to visit this repo: Welcome! Here's the home of the code for the WhatDoIDo project. The
idea behind the app is to suggest events one is most likely to enjoy. This came from a personal frustration with finding
events that sound cool but didn't know about until it was too late. I was lucky enough to receive the time to complete
this project while at Columbia.
